# Pokémon Random Battles Database

## Introduction

I've been playing the random battle format for quite a bit and although I'm not that good at it, it's a pretty fun format to play. However, one of the major gripes I've had was not really having an easy way to access the information of all the different Pokémon in the format. There's a browser plugin that allows us to see that information easily, but if I'm not mistaken, it was taken down from the Chrome Web Store, which was kind of a bummer to find out. Although the plugin is still accessible on Mozilla Firefox, I didn't want to rely on that browser just to have easy access to the information.

That's when I thought maybe I could at least make it easier for myself while using Google Chrome. I just so happen to be interested in things like spreadsheet development, process improvement, and data analytics for my work, so coming up with a creative solution for the data we have at hand would be a fun way for me to get my feet wet into that kind of work while I'm off the clock. 

The dataset I've used was provided by the randbats community which can be found [here](https://pkmn.github.io/randbats/data/gen8randombattle.json). 
I've referenced [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKYvrD-3Ksc) to complete this project. Whoever is behind the channel is a great teacher!

## Things to Know
Access the Pokémon Random Battles Database [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GyjPifLBY1-_kF1PZRqNghrKC4MGVKPRcxS45CbVG5o/edit?usp=sharing)!

* Make a copy of the spreadsheet for your personal use. 
* You will need to authorize the built-in App Script called "Randbats" in order for this spreadsheet to work. If you haven't authorized an App Script before, please refer to [this webpage](https://spreadsheet.dev/authorizing-an-apps-script) for clear and easy to follow instructions. 
* All your searches will be done on the Search sheet using the built-in search bar whether it'd be typing or using the drop down. The Pokémon Info and Move Info sheets are also included in case you may need to view the full list. 
* It's only been designed to search one Pokémon at a time and the script may take quite a bit of seconds to find the info, so please let it do its work. Sometimes, images may not display, so you may need to refresh the spreadsheet. 
* I'm not 100% sure if everything is accurate and I'm always open to feedback. Please reach out to me on Discord in case you have something to comment. *seta#5704*
