# Pokémon Randbats Database

## Introduction

I've been playing the random battle format for quite a bit and although I'm not that good at it, it's a pretty fun format to play. However, one of the major gripes I've had was not really having an easy way to access the information of all the different Pokémon in the format. There's a browser plugin that allows us to see that information easily, but if I'm not mistaken, it was taken down from the Chrome Web Store, which was kind of a bummer to find out. Although the plugin is still accessible on Mozilla Firefox, I didn't want to rely on that browser just to have easy access to the information.

That's when I thought maybe I could at least make it easier for myself while using Google Chrome. I just so happen to be interested in things like spreadsheet development, process improvement, and data analytics for my work, so coming up with a creative solution for the data we have at hand would be a fun way for me to get my feet wet into that kind of work while I'm off the clock. 

## The Public Dataset

Usually, one of the best things about Pokémon is the community behind it, and I'm glad there's someone in the community that gave us access to to all that data which I found [here](https://pkmn.github.io/randbats/data/gen8randombattle.json). However, it's not very intuitive and it looks like there's way too much to sift through. 

As I looked into the dataset, I unfortunately couldn't find a quick and easy way to clean it all up, so I ended up having to resort to doing a manual scrubbing which was a very, very tedious process...
